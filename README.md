# NewtonFractalVisualizer
This project is a software tool designed to create and display fractals generated by applying Newton's Method to cubic polynomials in the complex plane.

The primary goal of this project is to facilitate the exploration and understanding of fractal geometry, specifically Newton's fractals, through interactive visualizations. Users can observe how small changes in the input polynomial or the method's parameters influence the resulting fractal pattern, thereby gaining deeper insights into the dynamics of Newton's method in complex analysis.
